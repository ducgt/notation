# notation

Reading music sheets is hard. All I want to know is roughly where to put my fingers on the piano. Note length, tempo, velocity and other stuff are minor worries in comparison. Those things can be _felt_, without learning.

I wanted to create a simple, consistent music notation, along with parsers and converters. Turns out writing beautiful renderers is hard, and it can get quite messy with the variety of sheets out there. I haven't yet had the motivation to finish the code, so instead for some peace of mind, I'm documenting the envisioned notation here.
